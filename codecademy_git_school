Git

Git is a software to keep track of changes of a project.
Git records the changes you make to a project, stores the changes and let you reference them later.

Theres 3 part in a Git project
1. A working directory - The creating, editing, deleting and organization.
2. A staging area - you'll list changes you done in the working directory.
3. A repository - Where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.

How to create a Git project:
---------------------------------------
Step 1.
Create a project.
Example in atom. Save it in a folder.
---------------------------------------
Step 2.
Choose the folder and initialize it. Make the folder connected to Git.
In the terminal write:
git init (initialize)
--------------------------------------------
step 3.
Start track the project in git.
-git status-lets you see the status of the project.
After step 2, the project will be seen as red and the output will be "untracked files".
The git sees the file, but has not ben told to start tracking the project yet.
To track the project in git (needs to be added to the staging area):

 -git add filename-

After you added the file, check git status of the file. - A "new file: filename" will be in green, and tells that its added.
----------------------------------------------------
Step 4.
Save new changes.
Now the new file is added to the staging area. But if changes are made those have to be saved.
to view the changes made:
-git diff filename-
    ex:
        $ git diff scene-1.txt
        diff --git a/scene-1.txt b/scene-1.txt
        index 913b994..2d6e91a 100644
        --- a/scene-1.txt
        +++ b/scene-1.txt

To add the changes to the staging area in Git, you need to add the file again.
-git add filename-
----------------------------------------------
Step 5.
Commit - permanently store the changes from the staging area inside the repository.
To commit its also needed to comment changes -
Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:

-Must be in quotation marks
-Written in the present tense
-Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m

example:
git commit -m"Complete first line of dialogue"
---------------------------------------------------
Step 6.
Refer back to earlier versions of project

git log
output -->
A 40-character code, called a SHA, that uniquely identifies the commit. This appears in orange text.
The commit author
The date and time of the commit
The commit message

Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers
Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
  -git init (creates a new Git repository)
  -git status (inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area)
  -git add (adds files from the working directory to the staging area)
  -git diff (shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area)
  -git commit (permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository)
  -git log (shows a list of all previous commits)
